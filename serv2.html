<h3>
An online ordering system (separate from your regular website). 
Usually these supply HTML code for “order buttons” that you can paste into pages on your regular website.
 Your customer looks through your website to pick out products, but when she clicks on the order button, 
 she is transported to the ordering system (usually hosted on an entirely different website) to complete the transaction.
A store-building system, on the other hand, handles your webpages as well as orders on the same site.
If you’re selling only a few products, just an online ordering system will do fine. But when you try to display and sell 50 or 100 or 1,000 or 100,000 different products, you’ll need store-building, catalog-managing system, that produces and manages the product pages for each of your products.

<h4>The term “shopping cart” is inadequate to describe all the functions of the variety of modern e-commerce systems.
 “Storefront software” might be a better term. But, like it or not, the term “shopping cart” has stuck,
 so that’s the term I’ll be using throughout this book — “cart” for short — as a generic term to refer to both types of systems. 
 To distinguish between the two I’ll refer to an “online ordering system” or a “store-building system.”
