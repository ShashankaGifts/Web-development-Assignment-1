Shopify’s user experience is consistent across all devices. Only the call-to-action button and illustrations changed between desktop to mobile devices.

On personal computers and tablets, the call-to-action button is to the right of the form field. On mobile devices, it’s beneath.

Similarly, the illustrations are to the right of the copy on personal computers and tablets, whereas they’re placed beneath the copy on mobile devices.

Like most websites, Shopify’s menu is also replaced by a hamburger icon on handheld devices.

Despite using image carousels to show off their customers, they’ve managed to keep their page load speed below five seconds, which is pretty impressive.
